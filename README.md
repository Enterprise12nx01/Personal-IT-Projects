Personal Projects


Minecraft Modpack:
I created and still maintain a minecraft modpack since 2013. While i dont work on it much now, it still has a community that plays.
The modpack constists of 200~ mods to completely enhance and alter gameplay from original minecraft.
Original Modpack Hosted on Technicpack.net: https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/a-new-age-enterprise.55905
It reached 45k Installs and 154k Runs
New Modpack Location on Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/industrial-age-the-turning

I made a website for the server and modpack
https://www.nucleartekkit.enjin.com 
while it is no longer active due to the website company shutting down, it can still be viewed with waybackmachine(it is lacking detail due to the images not being captured or the links to them are now gone)
Homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20150917115103/http://nucleartekkit.enjin.com:80/
Forums: https://web.archive.org/web/20151115174724/http://nucleartekkit.enjin.com/forum (which had around 3k registered users with accounts before it shutdown)
Donations Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20151115181110/http://nucleartekkit.enjin.com/donate

The website had tutorials, forums, news announcements, events, a store/donation packages page and many other functions that helped grow the server community.
The website was linked to the server using plugins, users could donate on the website to immediately recieve in game items or commands configured in the TOML files.
the website would show the current server status, who and how many players were on along with our teamspeak server.
It also showcased our current staff. I had applications on the website for those who wanted to apply for a staff position, which included Moderators and Admins.
Moderators usually only had powers to moderate the server chat and ban players.
Admins had higher powers to teleport and help players or to verify they were not using any hacks or cheats.

The server and website paid for itself with the store and donations and i made a profit every year. 
By working on this project, i learned basic java. Java was required to read the log files when crashes or issues occured so i could diagnose which mod or mods were causing the issue, and implement a patch to it myself or notify the mod author.
I also took an offer for a partnership with bisecthosting: https://www.bisecthosting.com/
Bisecthosting is a gaming server host, they offered me 30% commission on any customers who buy a server through my link or code IATT, and in turn they are advertised through my modpack, on the menu or download site.
I am still in partnership with them today.

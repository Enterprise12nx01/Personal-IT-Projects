Personal Projects

Custom Built Computers:
I have been building and troubleshooting custom computers for 10 years, i started with my own and have built many computers ranging from office work to high end gaming desktops for my personal clients.

- The "Client Gaming PC" was built for a low end budget desktop, which i have updated over the years when requested.
- The "Germany Shipped Gaming PC" I built for a customer who was in the military over seas in Germany, as he wanted it made just how he wanted which online retailers dont offer much customization for pre-builts.
This was a high end system with all in one watercooling, gold/black themed.
Troubleshooting: When it arrived there i had to diagnose his hard drive had been damaged during shipping. Over his 4 years of training, i would troubleshoot and diagnose issues he had over the phone, whether it be audio issues, driver issues, etc.
His all in one liquid cooling for his CPU had began to fail, and i had to help him understand what i needed him to do, as he had no IT or troubleshooting knowledge.  He had said his pc was running extremely slow one day, after some troubleshooting, ruling out viruses, filled storage drive, or a failing drive and ruling out other possible issues from his description like a slow internet connection.
He was able to get it warrantied and replaced.
- The "Watercooled PCS" My personal project, i have built and upgraded my computer over the years, replacing old components or changing out cases. I started custom rigid watercooling a few years ago.

I have built other custom desktops, but dont have any pictures of them.
I have helped many clients by visiting them or having their desktop or laptops dropped off to be fixed. i have diagnosed and troubleshooted issues in person and over the phone, whether it be audio issues, display issues, failing PSU'S, failing GPU's, a cable dissonect, viruses, bios updates, power supply switch being off,
networking issues, updating their router or configuring it through web browser, these are just some examples of my hands on experience.

Minecraft Modpack:
I created and still maintain a minecraft modpack since 2013. It has around 50k Installs.  While i dont work on it much now, it still has a community that plays.
The modpack constists of 200~ mods to completely enhance and alter gameplay from original minecraft.
- Original Modpack Hosted on Technicpack.net: https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/a-new-age-enterprise.55905
It reached 45k Installs and 154k Runs
- New Modpack Location on Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/industrial-age-the-turning

I made a website for the server and modpack, it is now replaced by a discord server
- https://www.nucleartekkit.enjin.com 
while it is no longer active due to the website company shutting down, it can still be viewed with waybackmachine(it is lacking detail due to the images not being captured or the links to them are now gone)
- Homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20150917115103/http://nucleartekkit.enjin.com:80/
- Forums: https://web.archive.org/web/20151115174724/http://nucleartekkit.enjin.com/forum (which had around 3k registered users with accounts before it shutdown)
- Donations Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20151115181110/http://nucleartekkit.enjin.com/donate

The website had tutorials, forums, news announcements, events, a store/donation packages page and many other functions that helped grow the server community.
The website was linked to the server using plugins, users could donate on the website to immediately recieve in game items or commands configured in the TOML files.
the website would show the current server status, who and how many players were on along with our teamspeak server.
It also showcased our current staff. I had applications on the website for those who wanted to apply for a staff position, which included Moderators and Admins.
Moderators usually only had powers to moderate the server chat and ban players.
Admins had higher powers to teleport and help players or to verify they were not using any hacks or cheats.

The server and website paid for itself with the store and donations and i made a profit every year. 
By working on this project, i learned basic java. Java was required to read the log files when crashes or issues occured so i could diagnose which mod or mods were causing the issue, and implement a patch to it myself or notify the mod author.
I also took an offer for a partnership with bisecthosting: https://www.bisecthosting.com/
Bisecthosting is a gaming server host, they offered me 30% commission on any customers who buy a server through my link or code IATT, and in turn they are advertised through my modpack, on the menu or download site.
I am still in partnership with them today.
